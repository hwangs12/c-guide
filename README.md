## Why does C programming language have float and double to represent decimals?

> double stores high-precision floating-point data or numbers in computer memory. double has size of 8 bits while float has size of 4 bits.

## What differences are there between double and floating-point data?

> Single precision (float) gives you 23 bits of significand, 8 bits of exponent, and 1 sign bit.
> Double precision (double) gives you 52 bits of significand, 11 bits of exponent, and 1 sign bit.

## What is significand, exponent and sign bit?
